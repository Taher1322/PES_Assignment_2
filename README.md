# PES_Assignment_2
Code for Assignment 2 for PES, ECEN-5813, Fall 2021 - Due Date >> 9/14/2021 @ 10:30 AM MDT

I have included all the files used in the project codes.

Using CodeLite IDE with GCC compiler to run and test all the codes

The code contains .h and .c files

.h header files are used to define functions and then called in main

.c contains the production code as per functions

Test function for Circular Buffer includes various boundary cases and Enqueue--Dequeue operation. On the basis of each operation actual and expected values are compared. Once all the tests are performed it return 1 or 0 and prints the Pass/Fail message on output terminal.

To test you can directly call the functions from main.c by passing parameters and test the return values

Other way to test the code functionality is to run test functions in main and get the output in serial terminal

Both ways works fine !!
